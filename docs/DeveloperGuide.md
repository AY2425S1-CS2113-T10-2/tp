## Product scope
### Target user profile
Dr Bob is a General Practitioner running his own private clinic.
He manages everything independently, attending to numerous patients with diverse health concerns each day.  
The demanding workload and long hours often leave him exhausted and sleep-deprived.  
On his work desk, he relies on a personal desktop computer for his work. 

### Value proposition
BookBob assists Dr Bob in storing and retrieving his patients' information, including their name, NRIC, gender, date of 
birth, phone number, home address, allergies, medical history and visit records with details like diagnoses and 
prescribed medications. Additionally, BookBob helps Dr Bob stay organised by tracking his daily appointments and 
providing reminders of upcoming appointments at the start of each day.
