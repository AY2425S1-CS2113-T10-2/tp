## Overview
BookBob is a desktop application tailored for Dr Bobâ€™s private General Practitioner clinic. It facilitates the storage 
and retrieval of patient information, including names, NRICs, genders, dates of birth, phone numbers, home addresses, 
allergies, medical histories and visit records with details on diagnoses and prescribed medications. BookBob also helps 
Dr Bob stay organised by tracking daily appointments and providing reminders each morning. Optimised for a Command Line 
Interface (CLI), BookBob allows for efficient management of patient information and appointments.

### Summary of Contributions
- Code Contributed: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2425s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=g13nd0n)
- Enhancements implemented:
  New Features
  - Add appointment for future schedule
      - What it does: allow user to add appointments made with patients
      - Justifications: This features improve the product by allowing user to track their time to avoid possible 
        overbooking of time for consultation with patients
      - Highlights: 
        - The adding of appointment will also check if the time is available based on the current list of 
          appointments that have already been made. Additionally, it is taken into account that the consultation duration is 
          30 minutes. It will suggest the next available timing, ensuring that the time and consultation duration will not 
          clash with other appointments. The implementation is challenging as it requires a few conditional statement to
          take note of timings of the different appointments.
        - Furthermore, once added the appointment, the list of appointments will be sorted according to date and time. 
          Implementation required ensure the appointment class implements the Comparable interface and have the compareTo
          methods and sorting them out. Additionally, implementation will need to ensure that regardless the order of the 
          appointment is added, it will be sorted appropriately
          while comparison are correct
    - Delete appointments
      - What it does: delete appointments based on the specific nric, date and time given
      - Justification: This feature improves product by allowing user to delete the appointments that might have been 
        made on accident. It requires date and time to ensure that the appointment deleted is the correct appointment.
    - List all appointments
      - What it does: List all appointments in chronological order
      - Justification: This improves the product by allowing user to look at all the appointments that has been made
      - Highlights: The list of appointments will always be sorted as user should know the appointments in date order.
    - Find appointments based on specific keywords such as date, time, name or nric
      - What it does: Display all appointments based on the search keyword
      - Justifications: This feature improves the product by allowing users to find the appointments for the specific
        name, nric, date or time instead of listing all appointments and look for the appointments wanted
    - Appointments Notice upon logging in to the system
      - What it does: Display all the appointments for the day
      - Justification: This feature improves the product by removing the need for the user to list all appointments and 
        look for the appointments for the day.
    - Removal of appointments for the day
      - What it does: Automatically remove all the past appointments upon logging off
      - Justification: This feature improves the product by removing the need for user to personally delete the 
        appointments that have already passed.
      - Highlights: The appointments that are removed would be those that are before the time that the user logged off.
        Implementations would required to check both date and time before removal and not simply removing all the 
        appointments for the day.
